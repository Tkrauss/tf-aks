# Terraform Remote State for AzureRM
# Used to store the state of the deployment in a remote storage container.
# It is not possible to have Terraform provision its remote state and then perform the actual provision
# Therefore you need to run this manually in the first step, in case you intend to store the Terraform State remote.
